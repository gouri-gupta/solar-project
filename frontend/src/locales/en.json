      {
        "question": "What are the benefits of rooftop solar?",
        "answer": "Rooftop solar helps reduce electricity bills, provides clean and renewable energy, and makes effective use of unused roof space. It also offers long-term savings and energy independence."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much does it cost per kW?",
        "answer": "The cost per kW depends on the type of system, quality of components, and installation requirements. On average, rooftop solar systems are priced to recover their cost within a few years through electricity savings."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long does installation take?",
        "answer": "A standard rooftop solar installation usually takes 2 to 5 days, depending on system size and site conditions."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are government subsidies?",
        "answer": "Government subsidies are financial incentives provided to reduce the cost of installing rooftop solar systems. In India, residential consumers can benefit from subsidies under schemes such as the PM Surya Ghar (Rooftop Solar Scheme) by the Government of India, along with applicable state-level solar policies. Subsidy eligibility depends on system capacity, installation guidelines, and approval from authorized agencies."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the net metering rules?",
        "answer": "Net metering allows excess electricity generated by your solar system to be exported to the grid. The exported units are adjusted against your electricity bill as per local electricity board rules."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I maintain the panels?",
        "answer": "Solar panels require very little maintenance. Regular cleaning to remove dust and occasional inspection are usually sufficient to ensure efficient performance."
